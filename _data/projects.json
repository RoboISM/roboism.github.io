The aim was to develop python wrappers for <b>Pluto drones</b> than controlling them using ROS and making the drones autonomously traverse a rectangular trajectory through websockets and computer vision for pose estimation and localisation. Once this was done the next part was to develop algorithm was two drones where one drone would be the master and the other one would be the slave following the trajectory of the master drone, the team was able to develop solution for all the subproblems. The video of the same is also available on the YouTube channel of the club.",

We conceptualized IRis with the goal of making digital education a reality even in most remote areas of nation. We have modified the technology already in use, to develop a low cost alternative. At the heart of IRis lies an IR communication architecture instead of RF. Needless to say, IRis results in lower hardware cost and power consumption than its RF counterparts.<br>Coming to the technicalities of the project, IRis Slaves are driven by Attiny85 microcontrollers. IRis employs Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) using Master-Slave protocol to avoid interference and ensure hassle free communication. Presently, IRis can offer support to 63 polling devices, each hardcoded with a unique identity number.",

The challenge was to design a new set of ergonomic crutches which can solve the problems like a disabled person with regular crutches cannot climb stairs easily. No hands-free movements are possible, making it difficult to grab anything else, prolong use of crutches cause muscle pain and even muscle paralysis, portability issues and many more.<br>The new design of the ergonomic crutches uniquely tackle this problems. The armrest is at an angle to distribute the load evenly along the forearm. The pivot-less cuff allows full range of motion while maintaining one-piece design. The handle has an adjustable length which slides into the armrest providing a single solution for people with different arm length. The thigh cuff offers additional support to the body by reducing body load directly from the forearm and redistributing it through the thigh and transferring back to the ground. This reduces the stress from the forearm, and it prevents hand segs. Since this crutches design provides support at two points, a person can easily climb the stairs with comfort and ease without losing balance. Its design permits the person to fold it to half of its length, which makes it easy to store and portable. Through adjustment, pin person can adjust the height of the clutches for his/her needs",

Parashoot employs a dual camera system for precisely detecting the position of an object in 3D Cartesian coordinate space. The frames from both cameras are separately processed using OpenCV and humans are detected. By correlating the features between the two frames and applying some geometric calculations the coordinates of the intruder are computed. With the coordinates, a servo motor mounted on the bot will rotate to point the laser (gun or tranquilizer in practical scenario) at the target. Multiple IR emitters around both cameras make the bot capable of operations at night and in low visibility conditions as well",

We used 2 IR sensors to solve the maze using the left-hand algorithm. Four IRs were used to read data from nodes and 4 more were used to distinguish a node from a path. We used an RGB colour sensor to detect Red LED signals and an Ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles. We used a hall-effect sensor and magnets to calculate the bot's speed and adjusted it to the desired speed using PWM. Finally, a compass-sensor was used to calculate the angle turned by our bot and turn until we reached the correct angle where our correct path was. We also used an LCD display to display the values we read from a node.",

A complimentary filter was used to calculate the accurate inclination of the vehicle using the accelerometer and gyroscope readings from the MPU6050. The deviation from vertical axis was fed to the PD controller which controlled the high torque DC motor to generate a restoring torque. This restoring torque maintained the vertical position of the two-wheeler. The chassis was 3D printed using PLA. This project won the 2nd Runners-up in the competition.",
